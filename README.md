# **ðŸ‘¾ Steam's Videogames Platform**

Exploration and analysis of the video game market on Steam using PySpark and Databricks.

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the video games available on the Steam platform. The study was conducted as part of a fictional collaboration with Ubisoft, which is looking to better understand the current trends in the gaming market in preparation for launching a new, groundbreaking title.

Using Databricks and the power of PySpark, I conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into game genres, publisher behavior, release trends, pricing strategies, platform distribution, and more.

### **Objectives **

The main goal is to identify key factors that influence a game's popularity or sales performance. To achieve this, I explored the dataset through multiple levels of analysis:

- Macro-level analysis: overall market trends (yearly release patterns, most active publishers, language distribution, COVID impact, etc.)

- Genre analysis: most popular, profitable, or highly rated genres; publisher genre preferences

- Platform analysis: availability across Windows, Mac, and Linux; genre-platform affinities

- Pricing and discount analysis: price distributions, presence of discounted games

### **Technologies Used**

- Databricks for data processing and visualization
- PySpark for large-scale data manipulation
- Python for advanced transformations
- Databricks Dashboard for interactive visualizations

### **Dataset** 

The dataset used comes from an S3 bucket and contains detailed information about thousands of games available on Steam: s3://full-stack-bigdata-datasets/Big_Data/Project_Steam/steam_game_output.json
